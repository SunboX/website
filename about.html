    <h1>About JanOS</h1>
    <p>
      JanOS is an alternative operating system for mobile phones,
      designed to run on devices without their screen attached.
      It was demonstrated as a proof of concept during
      <a href="http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/#/speakers/jan-jongboom-abusing-phones-to-make-the-internet-of-things" target="_blank">JSConf.EU 2014</a>.
      Shortly after it was chosen as the OS that powers Gonzo,
      a cellular connected and low-power camera.
      The project is maintained and funded by
      <a href="http://telenordigital.com/" target="_blank">Telenor Digital</a>.

  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>
    In the winter of 2013-2014 Olav Nymoen
    was working on a concept where he would replace the Firefox OS frontend
    with a cloud-based website.
    This meant stripping down the OS to it's bare bones, and then building it up
    again.
    Although this project got nowhere, it planted an important seed.
    A few months later Sergi Mansilla and Jan Jongboom, working on very cheap
    Firefox OS phones, were amazed by the qualities of these sub-30$ phones,
    especially compared to exisiting internet of things boards like the Arduino.
    Jan figured it would make for a very interesting project to re-use
    these cheap phones as proper IoT boards, and wrote a proposal for JSConf.EU,
    which was accepted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without a working proof of concept, but with a talk coming up,
    Jan started in August 2014 on stripping down Firefox OS.
    After a week of hacking the OS would
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jan-os/janos/blob/79bfb63325b6a49767e214a6c45929e2f7b5ed93/apps/system/index.html">boot</a>,
    although it took until September until cellular connectivity worked.
    A week before JSConf the mainboard was removed from it's casing for the first
    time, and it took a few all-nighters to figure out how to not overheat
    the device, and when the battery needed to be connected.
  </p>
  <p>
    End of September the project was demonstrated to great interest at JSConf.EU.
    As no-one had any inspiration, and the project was not meant to stick,
    the name remained JanOS.

    The day after the presentation Jan and Olav came together during a Telenor Digital
    offsite event in Lom, Norway; and discussed potential real use cases for
    the project. During these days they came up with a low-powered cellular-connected
    camera which you could stick anywhere.
    Going to a URL would wake up the device and send a still photo.
    This project was pitched to upper management over beer, and within a few
    days the project got successfully accepted in the Exploratory Engineering
    project ran by Telenor's Chief Scientist Bjorn Borud.

    In the project Thomas Langas joined the project as hardware engineer,
    and he started work on hardware design; PCBs; and hacking volume buttons
    into GPIO ports. He is also responsible for any kernel work in JanOS.
    The work done for Gonzo got then back ported into JanOS,
    which transformed from a simple alternative frontend for Firefox OS to
    a proper OS with it's own kernel changes and new APIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In December 2014 a
    <a href="http://ee.telenor.io/gonzo/hardware/2014/12/16/firefox-os-iot.html" target="_blank">blog post about the project</a>
    reached number 1 in Reddit Programming, after which was decided to turn JanOS
    into a real project, with documentation; builds; and a website.

  <h3>JanOS & Firefox OS</h3>
  <p>
    Originally meant as an alternative frontend to Firefox OS,
    the project still owes a ton to Mozilla's project and uses ~80%
    of all Firefox OS code.
    Here's a small comparison on changes that were made compared to Firefox OS.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Gonk (kernel):
        Updated the kernel to re-map buttons to act as GPIO ports,
        and ship a different set of misc binaries.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gecko (render engine):
        Add new APIs to deal with process execution and low-level
        device access.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gaia (frontend):
        We use a few files from the Firefox OS frontend, mainly around
        APN resolution and CPU wake locks.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We intend to contribute our changes in Gecko back to Mozilla,
    but so far Mozilla did not take any interest in them.

  <h3>Source Code</h3>
  <p>
    All source code, from website to kernel changes, is hosted in our
    GitHub repository.
    If you have generic improvements that would also benefit Firefox OS,
    please commit them to Mozilla's official repositories,
    which acts as the upstream to most JanOS repositories.
