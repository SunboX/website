    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <p>
      You flashed your device with JanOS, now it's time to test some examples
      that come bundled with the OS.
      This guide does not require you to do any hard programming,
      but you will need to know how to connect the debugging tools.
      All the examples can be run from the debugging console.

<div class="section secondary">
  <h3>Device Motion</h3>
  <p>
    The board contains a couple of sensors on which you can measure device motion.
    For example: the accelerometer or the gyroscope.
    This example logs the values on the Z-axis of the accelerometer to the
    console window. This is the axis on which you can measure gravity.
    For example, see what happens when you turn the board upside down.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
devicemotion.start();

// to stop
devicemotion.stop();
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="section secondary">
  <h3>Security Camera</h3>
  <p>
    The security camera demo makes a photo on a set interval, and saves it
    to the internal storage of the device.
    When you're done with the camera, you can pull the images off the device
    through adb.
    If you have two cameras on the board, you can use 'front' instead of
    'back' as well.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
securityCam.start('back', 5000);

// it will now make a photo every 5s. and log a message
// when you're done:
securityCam.stop();</code></pre>
  <p>
    Now you can grab the photos of the device via adb.
    Navigate to an empty folder, and run the following command:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">
$ adb pull /data/local/security/ .</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="section secondary">
  <h3>Bluetooth doorbell</h3>
  <p>
    For this example you'll need a bluetooth speaker.
    We'll connect to the bluetooth speaker, and then use the
    proximity sensor (on the front top of your board) to detect when someone
    is close to the sensor.
    If that's the case we'll play a sound over the speaker.
    If you don't know the bluetooth address of your speaker, enable it and then
    run:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
window.findBluetoothDevices();

// Will log something like:
"Starting discovery"
"Found device" "00:0C:8A:75:EF:31" "Bose Mini Sou" "audio-card"
"Stopping discovery"</code></pre>
  <p>
    We now use the address that has been logged to start the demo:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
doorbell.start("00:0C:8A:75:EF:31");

// And to stop
doorbell.stop();</code></pre>
  <p>
    Hover your hand over the proximity sensor to hear the doorbell sound playing.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section secondary">
  <h3>Tracker</h3>
  <p>
    This example uses a combination of APIs to make a tracking device.
    It connects to the internet, and registers with the push server.
    Whenever someone sends a push message to the device, the device will wake up,
    and sends it GPS location.
    First, we need to connect to a network.
    Connect to WiFi via:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
enableWifi('YOUR_NETWORK', 'YOUR_PASSWORD');

// This will log something like:
"Wifi statuschange" "connecting" bootstrap
"Wifi statuschange" "associated"
"Attempting to connect to" "YOUR_NETWORK"
"Associated" "YOUR_NETWORK"
"Wifi connection succeeded"
"Wifi now has IP" "192.168.2.7"</code></pre>
  <p>
    Now start the tracker, by running:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
tracker.start('http://janjongboom.com:1339', 'YOUR_NAME');

// Log will look like:
"[Tracker] Creating"
"[Tracker] Post to" "http://janjongboom.com:1339/register"
"[Tracker] Registration succeeded, listening on" "XXX"</code></pre>
  <p>
    Now go to the tracker page to send a push message.
    This page is located at:
    http://janjongboom.com:1339/location/YOUR_NAME.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're here click the 'Request new location' button, and switch back to the console.
    After a second or two the following messages should appear:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
"[Tracker] got push message!" Object {}
"autogrant permissions for" Object {}
"[Tracker] sendLocation" Coordinates {}
"[Tracker] sent location response" 200</code></pre>
  <p>
    If you go back to the tracker page you'll now see your current location
    shown on a map.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Note: if you see a message about a fake location and a map in Oslo,
    check the other messages in the console.
    Probably the GPS lookup failed because of a timeout.</em>
  </p>
