    <h2>Turn your phone into an IoT board</h2>
    <p>
      JanOS is an operating system designed to run on the chipset of
      mobile phones. It runs without a screen, and allows you to access
      all phone functionality, from calling to the camera, through
      JavaScript APIs.

  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>
    Current development boards for Internet of Things solutions have
    one big problem: they are very expensive.
    Boards like the Raspberry Pi or Arduino have a limited feature set
    and simple extensions, like a GSM shield, can cost $80.
    That is a shockingly high price when a full smartphone can be available
    for just $30.
    Why not break out the mainboard from a mobile phone and use that to
    develop embedded projects? Cheaper and more powerful.

  <h3>Getting started</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Get a mobile phone from our <a href="/device-list.html">supported device list</a></li>
    <li>Get a <a href="/download.html">ready-made build</a>,
      or <a href="/device-list.html#how-to-build">build your own</a>
    </li>
    <li>Clone <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/jan-os/janos">our app template</a>
      and write <a href="/articles/first-app.html">your first program</a></li>
    <li>Run <span class="code">make reset-phone</span> to update the device</li>
    <li>When all is up and running,
      <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/Uy062kp-LM4?t=5m11s">screw open your device</a>
      and remove the mainboard</li>
    <li>Build the mainboard into something else</li>

  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Can I attach sensors or LEDs?</strong>
    Most phones have some
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output">GPIO ports</a>
    that you can use to attach extra
    electronics to the board, like a LED light.
    We wrote a <a href="#">blog post</a> describing the process of
    attaching and controlling a LED on the GeeksPhone Keon.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Does it run native code?</strong>
    You can compile any C/C++ binary for the ARM architecture using
    the Android NDK / toolchains, and
    use the <a href="/api-reference/exec.html">mozOs.exec</a> API to invoke the binary from
    JanOS. <a href="/articles/cross-compile.html">Here's an example</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What about power efficiency?</strong>
    This depends on the mobile phone you use as a base.
    General idle consumption over 2G is 5 - 10 mA per hour.
    You can use a digital USB ammeter to measure the actual consumption.

      Read more here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Do I need a battery?</strong>
    So far all phones we encountered need a battery connected for most
    things (booting, searching for WiFi networks, etc.).
    It's quite easy to solder a battery to the board though.
    If you use soldering wire you can position it
    <a href="/img/gonzo-worked-open.jpg">behind the board</a>
    without much hassle.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Is there a debugger?</strong>
    You can use the
    <a href="/articles/first-app.html#debugger">WebIDE</a>,
    which is part of the Firefox Developer Tools to connect to your device
    and debug it.
